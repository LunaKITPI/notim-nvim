vim.cmd("colorscheme kanagawa-wave") -- kanagawa is the default theme, the flavours for this are : lotus, wave, dragon | lotus is a light theme, the other 2 are dark themes
-- this is the user personal config file,  changes made here overwrite the main setup ( for example if you type "vim.opt.number = false" the numbers will dissapear, no need to change to root dir)
